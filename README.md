# Random-Walks
Introducotry project to learn more about mathematica.

It uses Mathematica to display random walks in several dimensions (from 1D to 3D), then it explores some of the statistics behind this process using some of the Wolfram language tools to display the data.
## Results
These are some images produced using this simulation.

Each Line represents a different random walk

### Random Walk in 1 Dimension
